Fuzzy command history and directory tree searching can be enabled through the use of [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and its associated ZSH plugin.

- `Ctrl-R` will be bound to your command history by default
- `Ctrl-T` will perform a fuzzy search for a file in your current directory tree.  This can be triggered part way through typing a command to quickly fill in a file path.
